rationale_interpretation: "UNEP is available to assist operationalizing these proposed indicators through the Global Nutrient Partnership and Marine Litter Partnership working with IOC, GESAMP, others etc. The earlier proposed indicator on Nitrogen Use Efficiency is to some extend embedded with the broader Index of Coastal Eutrophication (ICEP). \nMoreover, 18 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans are currently working to develop a core set of common indicators to be used across regional seas for routing monitoring and reporting on the status of the marine environment. Several proposed indicators are relevant to 14.1, for example: (a) Chlorophyll a concentration as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass; (b) Locat'ons and frequency of algal blooms reported (c) Trends for selected priority chemicals 'nclud'ng POPs and heavy metals; (d) Quantification and class'f'cat'on of beach litter items, as well as indicators related to management of marine pollution and debris."
